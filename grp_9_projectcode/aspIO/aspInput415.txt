	(NEW YORK, March 7,1921) - Some men have foolish ideas.@@@@Take Robert H. Goddard, for example.@@@@Robert H. Goddard is causing a great deal of fuss these days.@@@@Goddard has a silly idea that Robert H. Goddard thinks will work.@@@@Robert H. Goddard says it is possible to make a machine that will fly in outer space.@@@@Goddard calls his machine a "rocket.@@@@Robert H. Goddard has never made one, but he has written about it.rocket @@@@Robert H. Goddard believes that someday a rocket can travel to the moon.@@@@It is true that a few years ago, people laughed at the idea that man could fly.@@@@Then the Wright Brothers flew the first airplane.@@@@But a plane needs air to fly.@@@@In outer space, there is no air.@@@@Even an airplane can't work in outer space.@@@@That is why everyone knows that a rocket certainly could not make the long trip.@@@@Still, Goddard keeps working on his idea.@@@@In 1914, Robert H. Goddard received a patent for his rocket.@@@@A patent is a piece of paper that gives the owner the right to make money from an idea.@@@@Goddard may have a patent, but Robert H. Goddard has yet to build a rocket and prove rocket can fly in space.@@@@This newspaper thinks it's time that people like Goddard stop trying to fool the public.@@@@Most of the world's great machines have already been built.@@@@Dreamers like Goddard should start building useful things that will help people.@@@@1#  Who has a foolish idea?@@@@2#  What is his idea?@@@@3#  When did Goddard get a patent?@@@@4#  Where does Goddard think his rocket could go?@@@@5#  Why is this a silly idea?
