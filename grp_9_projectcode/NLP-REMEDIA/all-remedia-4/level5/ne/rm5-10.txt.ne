Stock Market Crashes!



	(<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 29,1929</TIMEX>) - <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> will go down in history as one of the worst days ever.  Millions of people lost some or all of their money in the stock market.

	The stock market is something like a store.  Instead of buying food and clothes, people buy and sell small parts of companies.  Each part is called a share, or a stock.  Those who own stock become part owners of the companies.

	When a company makes money, the people who own stock make money, too.  When a company loses money, those who hold stock lose money, too.

	<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>, just about every company lost money.  Many of the stock owners went broke because of it.  People are saying the stock market crashed.

	Why did the stock market crash?  Lately, more and more people have been buying stocks.  As they did so, the prices went up.  To earn more money, the stockholders have been selling their stocks to new stockholders.  With the money they earned, they bought more stocks at higher prices.

	But, the people finally ran out of money to spend.  Instead of buying, everyone wanted to sell their stocks at once.  This made the prices drop.

	In time, the prices of stocks may climb again.  For many, however, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> is the day they lost their life savings.
