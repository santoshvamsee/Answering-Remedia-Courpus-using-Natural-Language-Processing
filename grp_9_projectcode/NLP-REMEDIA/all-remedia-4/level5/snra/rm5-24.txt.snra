<ANSQ1>Wright Brothers Claim They Can Fly!</ANSQ1>



	(KITTY HAWK, N.C., December 17, 1903) Two men have made a claim that is very hard to believe.  <ANSQ3>They say that they used a machine to fly today.</ANSQ3>

	<ANSQ1>The two brothers are named Orville and Wilbur Wright.</ANSQ1>  They say they have five witnesses who saw them fly.  They also say they used a heavier-than-air machine to make four trips.  The longest trip lasted almost a minute and lifted them 850 feet above the ground.

	This report will be carefully checked.  <ANSQ5>Just a few months ago, Mr. Simon Newcomb proved that it is not possible to fly.</ANSQ5>  He could not be reached for a comment today.

	<ANSQ4>Not much is known about the Wright brothers, except that they own a bicycle repair shop in Dayton, Ohio.</ANSQ4>

	The two were asked how their machine stayed in the air.  <ANSQ2>The brothers said that they used movable parts on the wings to control it.</ANSQ2>  They claim that they built their machine after making smaller scale models that worked.  The Wrights say they have worked on this machine for seven years, at a cost of $1,000.
