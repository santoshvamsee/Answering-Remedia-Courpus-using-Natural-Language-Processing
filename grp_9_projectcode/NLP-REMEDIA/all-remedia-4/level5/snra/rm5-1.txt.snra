	Quints are quite rare.  They happen only once in every 85 million births.  The Fischer quints are the first ones born in the United States that have lived.  Those born in the past lived only hours or days.  <ANSQ5>Most quints are so tiny that their hearts and lungs are not big enough to keep them alive.</ANSQ5>
