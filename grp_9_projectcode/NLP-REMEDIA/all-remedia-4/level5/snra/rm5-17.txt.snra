Train Links Countries for Fast Travel



	(PARIS, October 4, 1882) - A train leaves Paris today on a trip that will make history.  The train will travel through several countries until it reaches Romania.  This is the first time that countries in Europe have been linked by train service.

	The train is called the Orient Express. It travels at speeds of 50 miles per hour. <ANSQ5>Each of the train's cars have strong springs which give passengers a smooth ride.</ANSQ5>

	Guests on the train will be treated very well. One of the cars has been turned into a dining room.  Guests will enjoy meals prepared in a fully-stocked kitchen which is in another car.

	When they are sleepy, guests can take a nap in one of two sleeping cars.  There are other cars for their suitcases, and a separate car that contains mail.

	<ANSQ3>The train trip to Romania should take about eight hours.</ANSQ3>  When they arrive, the guests will leave the train.  They will hop on a ferryboat and cross a river.  <ANSQ4>Then they will board a second train that will take them as far as Turkey.</ANSQ4>
