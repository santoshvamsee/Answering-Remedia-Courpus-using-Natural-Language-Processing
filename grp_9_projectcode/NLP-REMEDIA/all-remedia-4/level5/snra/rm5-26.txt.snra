Doctors Find Cause of Yellow Fever



	<ANSQ3>(HAVANA, CUBA, February 22, 1902) -</ANSQ3> At long last, science has learned how people get yellow fever.  This dreaded disease kills thousands of people around the world each year.

	<ANSQ2>A team of army doctors has learned that the disease is carried by a certain kind of mosquito.</ANSQ2>  When it bites its victim, the germs enter the bloodstream.  Within a few days or weeks, the person comes down with a high fever and tires easily.  The skin takes on the color that gives the disease its name.

	<ANSQ1>Major Walter Reed heads the team that discovered the cause.</ANSQ1>  His helper is Dr. James Carroll.  These men are very brave and risked their own lives while working with these mosquitoes.  <ANSQ5>One of their team members, Dr. Jesse Lazear, died when he was bit while he worked in his lab.</ANSQ5>

	For years, it was known that yellow fever is found mostly in warm, wet climates.  <ANSQ4>Many cases have been reported in Cuba and the Philippine Islands.</ANSQ4>

	The city of Havana plans to spray all neighborhoods.  This will help kill the mosquitoes.
