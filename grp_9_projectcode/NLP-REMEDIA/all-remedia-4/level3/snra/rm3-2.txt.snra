	All at once, a guard came along.  He whispered in Mr. Hoover's ear.  They both left the room.
	Soon the children heard fire engines.  Were they surprised!  <ANSQ2>The White House was on fire.</ANSQ2>
	Many fire trucks stopped nearby.  <ANSQ4>Firemen jumped to the ground with hoses.</ANSQ4>  They climbed tall ladders.  They sprayed water on the flames.
