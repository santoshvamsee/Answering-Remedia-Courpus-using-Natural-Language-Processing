<ANSQ1>Sailors Make Strange Discovery!</ANSQ1>

	<ANSQ3>(HOLLAND, April 10, 1723)-</ANSQ3><ANSQ2><ANSQ1>One year ago today, Dutch sailors found a strange, new island.</ANSQ1></ANSQ2>  <ANSQ3>They named it Easter Island, in honor of the day they found it.</ANSQ3>
	But, only now have the sailors returned from their long trip.  They have strange tales to tell.  They say that Easter Island is full of huge statues with faces carved on them.  The statues are made from rocks.  The rocks were carried many miles.  Then they were placed upright in the ground.
	No one knows who carved these faces.  The sailors could not find any people on Easter Island.
	Each statue weighs many tons.  It is hard for the sailors to guess how the rocks were moved, then lifted.  The sailors also don't know whose faces are on the rocks.  The faces have very big noses and lips.
	<ANSQ4>Easter Island is far away in the South Pacific Ocean.</ANSQ4>  Maybe, someday, people will return to solve these mysteries.
