Jet Airplanes Take Off!

	<ANSQ3>(LOS ANGELES, 1950)-</ANSQ3>Airplanes are getting bigger and better all the time.  A new plane has just been built.  It is called a jet.  It does not need propellers to stay in the air.
	<ANSQ2>A jet has a special engine.</ANSQ2>  It sucks in air at the front of the plane.  The air gets pushed out at the back.  <ANSQ5>This helps it to stay high in the sky.</ANSQ5>
	An older plane may have a propeller that quits.  This will not happen with jets. <ANSQ1>Pilots like jets because they lift off the ground with ease.</ANSQ1>
	Airplanes are also getting bigger.  A 160-foot-long plane was just built.  If you could stand it on its end, it would be 16 stories tall.
	Planes are flying faster now.  A plane can fly faster than the speed of sound.  People thought this could not be done.  <ANSQ4>When planes fly that fast, they make a big boom in the sky.</ANSQ4>  The boom can be heard on the ground miles away.
