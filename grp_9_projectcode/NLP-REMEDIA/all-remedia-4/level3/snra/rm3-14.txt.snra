	The space shuttle was launched, or shot, into space like spaceships before it.  But it can land like an airplane.  Never before could a spaceship return to Earth without splashing into the ocean.
	Young and Crippen are pilots.  They have spent years training for these few days in space.  <ANSQ3>They will land in California later this week.</ANSQ3>
	<ANSQ5>The best thing about the space shuttle is that it can be used again.</ANSQ5>  After it returns, it will be cleaned up and checked over.  Then it will be flown back to Florida on the top of an airplane.
