Rare Egg Found

	(<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">UTAH</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 31,1989</TIMEX>)-A rare egg has been found.  It was not found in a bird's nest.  This egg will never hatch.  It contains the remains of a tiny dinosaur.  This is one of the oldest dinosaur eggs ever found.  It is about 100 million years old.
	Some scientists were digging in the ground.  They were in a spot where 12,000 dinosaur bones have been found.  So they were not too surprised to find the egg.
	The egg was found in a dry spot.  But at one time, the area was a shallow lake.  The dinosaur's mother must have been standing in the lake.  She got stuck in the mud and could not get out.
	Some people took a special picture of the egg.  It is called an X-ray.  It lets them see inside the egg.  The shell does not have to be cracked open.
	Inside the egg, they can see a creature.  It is the size of a small animal.
