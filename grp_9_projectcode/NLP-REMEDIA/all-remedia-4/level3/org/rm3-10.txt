Television Celebrates 50 Years

	(NEW YORK, April 30,1989) - The TV set is 50 years old today!  It was on this day in 1939 that the first program was shown.  The show was live, not taped.  It was about the New York World's Fair.
	People were amazed that they could see pictures and hear sound at the same time.  In those days, there was no such thing as color TV.  All the shows were in black and white.
	The first television sets were rather strange-looking.  They had tiny screens and were mounted on tall legs.  Each TV had to be hooked up to special wires underground.  A TV could be bought for about $200.  But not many of them were sold until about 1948.
	Color television came about in the early 1960's.  The Walt Disney Show was the first TV show to air in color each week.
	The pictures you see are really made from tiny dots.  The dots move across the screen in patterns.  They form the faces and buildings you see on your television.
