	This is the first time such a talk has been shown on TV.  It is called a debate.  People who run for office often take part in a debate, but never on TV.

	<ANSQ4>The two men will stand on a stage.</ANSQ4>  Reporters will ask them many questions.  They will have 2 1/2 minutes to answer each question.  The questions will be about subjects such as how to spend our country's money and how to keep our country safe.

	<ANSQ2>The talks are being called the "Great Debates."</ANSQ2> Each one will last for one hour.  The shows will be watched by about 70 million people.  <ANSQ5>This will help citizens make up their minds about how to vote.</ANSQ5>  <ANSQ3>The voting will take place in early November.</ANSQ3>
