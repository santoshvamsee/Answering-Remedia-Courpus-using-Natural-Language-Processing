<ANSQ2>Divers Spend Two Weeks Underwater</ANSQ2>



	(ST.  JOHN, Virgin Islands, July 20,1970) - <ANSQ2>A team of five women surfaced today after spending two weeks underwater.</ANSQ2>  They are part of a team that studies ocean plants and animals.

	<ANSQ3>On July 6, they entered the water.</ANSQ3>  <ANSQ4>They lived in two white tanks placed below the surface.</ANSQ4>  Each day, they left the tanks for several hours to scuba dive.  "Scuba" means to swim underwater using air from a machine.

	The team would swim as far as 1,500 feet away from the tanks.  Each dive lasted about four hours.  <ANSQ2>The women breathed air through a new kind of machine.</ANSQ2>  It weighs 65 pounds.  However, it does not send air bubbles to the surface.  This lets the divers swim close to fish without scaring them.

	Their hard work paid off.  <ANSQ2><ANSQ5>They studied 35 kinds of fish and found 150 types of plants.</ANSQ5></ANSQ2>  Many of these had never been seen before.

	<ANSQ1>Their team leader was Dr. Sylvia Earle Mead, age 35.</ANSQ1>  She has been a scuba diver since she was a teenager.  Was Sylvia scared to have her feet off the ground for so long?  "it was the safest two weeks of my life," she said.
