Football Catches On Fast







	<ANSQ4>(LATROBE, PA., September 4, 1895) -</ANSQ4> The new game of football is catching on fast, and each month new teams are being formed.

	Last night was the first time that a football player was paid.  <ANSQ5><ANSQ1>The man's name is John Brallier, and he was paid $10 to take the place of someone who was hurt.</ANSQ1></ANSQ5>

	<ANSQ2>John's team is called the Jeannette Sports Club.</ANSQ2>  He is the quarterback.  The other team was the Latrobe YMCA.  Even with John's paid help, his team lost 12-0.

	More and more colleges are starting football teams.  They travel many miles to play other good teams.  On Christmas Day, 1894, a college team from Chicago went to San Francisco to play.

	<ANSQ3>The first football game between two schools took place in 1869.</ANSQ3>  Then the manner of keeping score was different.  Each time a touchdown was made, the team would score one point.  The first team to reach six points would win.  A game lasted about one hour.

Now the rules have changed.  A touchdown is worth six points.
