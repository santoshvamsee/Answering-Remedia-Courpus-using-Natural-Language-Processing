Owens Wins 4th Gold Medal!

	(MUNICH, GERMANY, 1936) - Jesse Owens is the fastest man in the world.  He runs and wins for the United States team.  Today, Jesse won his fourth gold medal in the Olympics.
	Each time he wins a medal, it is placed around his neck.  A band plays the "Star-Spangled Banner."
	This is not the first time Jesse has shown his speed.  A few years ago, he broke five world records.  In fact, he did this in one hour.
	Jesse's future was not always bright.  As a boy, he was quite sick and weak.  Some winters, he could not go to school.  All he could do was stay in bed.
	In high school, he began to train.  He could not run after school because he had a job.  So he would get up early and run.  At first, he just wanted to build his strength.  Later, he began to race against others.
	The sick, young boy grew into a strong man.  Now Jesse's name will be known around the world.  He has earned a place in sports history.
