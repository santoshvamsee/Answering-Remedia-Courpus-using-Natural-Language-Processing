Storybook Person Found Alive!

   (ENGLAND, June, 1989) - Christopher Robin is alive and well.  He lives in England.  He is the same person that you read about in the book, Winnie the Pooh.
   As a boy, Chris lived in a pretty home called Cotchfield Farm.  When Chris was three years old, his father wrote a poem about him.  The poem was printed in a magazine for others to read.   
   Mr. Robin then wrote a book.  He made up a fairy tale land where Chris lived.  His friends were animals.  There was a bear called Winnie the Pooh.  There was also an owl and a young pig, called a piglet.  All the animals were stuffed toys that Chris owned.  Mr. Robin made them come to life with his words.  The places in the story were all near Cotchfield Farm. 
   Winnie the Pooh was written in 1925.  Children still love to read about Christopher Robin and his animal friends.  Most people don't know he is a real person who is grown now.  He has written two books of his own.  They tell what it is like to be famous.
