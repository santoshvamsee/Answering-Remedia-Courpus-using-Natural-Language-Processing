Tomb Keeps Its Secrets

	(<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EGYPT</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1951</TIMEX>) - A tomb was found this year.  It was a tomb built for a king.  The king lived more than <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">4,000 years ago</TIMEX>.  His home was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>.
	For years, no one saw the tomb.  It was carved deep in rock.  The wind blew sand over the top and hid it.  Then a team of diggers came along.  Their job was to search for hidden treasures.
	What they found thrilled them.  Jewels and gold were found in the tomb.  The king's treasures were buried inside 132 rooms.
	The men opened a 10-foot-thick door.  It was 130 feet below the earth.  Using torches, they saw a case.  "It must contain the king's mummy!" they said.  A mummy is a body wrapped in sheets.
	With great care, the case was removed.  It was taken to a safe place to be opened.  For two hours, workers tried to lift the lid.  At last, they got it off.
	Inside they saw ... nothing!  The case was empty.  No one knows where the body is hidden.  A new mystery has begun.
