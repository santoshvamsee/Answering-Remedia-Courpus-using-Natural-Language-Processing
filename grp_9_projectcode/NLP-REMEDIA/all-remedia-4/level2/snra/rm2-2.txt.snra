Pony Express Makes Final Run

	(JOPLIN, MISSOURI, October 26, 1861) From now on, mail will be sent a new, faster way.  It is called the telegraph.  It uses wires to send messages.  Now there will be no need for the Pony Express.  <ANSQ3>Since April, 1860, mail has been sent this way.</ANSQ3>
	<ANSQ1>The last Pony Express rider leaves town today.</ANSQ1>  His horse will carry sacks full of mail.  He will ride for 15 miles.  <ANSQ4>Then the rider will stop at a swing station.</ANSQ4>  There he will get a fresh horse.  The rider will also have a hot meal there.
	Like most Pony Express riders, he will ride about 75 miles today.  He will make about five stops.
	Last year, the Pony Express was a new way to deliver the mail.  Brave, young men were hired to ride the horses.  Along the way, they often met thieves.  Sometimes their horses got hurt.
	Before the Pony Express, mail was sent by stagecoach.  The Pony Express was 12 to 14 days faster than the coach.  Now, there is another newer, faster way to send mail.
