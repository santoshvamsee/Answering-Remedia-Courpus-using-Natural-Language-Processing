Colorful Planet Being Explored

	<ANSQ3>(Somewhere in outer space, March, 1989) -</ANSQ3> Deep in the darkness, a small spacecraft heads for the planet Mars.  It should reach this planet in a few months. Then it will begin to take photos. 
	<ANSQ4>If you were on this spacecraft, you would see strange sights on Mars.</ANSQ4>  The soil is every shade of red you can imagine.  At times, red dust storms cover the planet. 
	In the morning, you would wake up to pink skies.  At night, you would see blue sunsets.  And, you would look upon not one, but two moons!  In fact, on some nights, one of the moons rises twice. 
	The spacecraft will take pictures of these moons.  It won't have to land.  <ANSQ2>It will point laser beams at the surface and shoot.</ANSQ2>  Poof!  Rocks will fly every which way.  The rocks will be studied to see what they contain.
