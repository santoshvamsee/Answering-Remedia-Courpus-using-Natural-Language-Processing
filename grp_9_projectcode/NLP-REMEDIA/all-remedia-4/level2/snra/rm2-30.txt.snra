King and Queen Have New Throne

	<ANSQ4><ANSQ3>(EGYPT, 1966) -</ANSQ3></ANSQ4> A team of workers has finished a tough job.  They have spent five years moving heavy statues.  The statues were old.  <ANSQ2>They were about to be covered with water.</ANSQ2>  <ANSQ5>The workers moved them to higher ground.</ANSQ5>
	At one time, the statues were safe.  They were carved in rock next to the Nile River.  Then a big dam was built to hold back the water.  The dam formed a lake. The lake would keep the Nile from flooding.  It would also cover the statues.
	Piece by piece, the statues were moved.  Four big ones went first.  Six smaller ones followed.  <ANSQ1>They were statues of a king and queen from Egypt.</ANSQ1>  Even the smaller ones were much taller than most buildings.
	Now there is no chance the water will cover them.  The king and his queen have a great view of the Nile River.
