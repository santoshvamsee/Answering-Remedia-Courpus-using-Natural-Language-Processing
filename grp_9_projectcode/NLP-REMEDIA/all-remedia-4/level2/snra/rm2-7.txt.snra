Sailor Spends 4 Years on Island

	(SCOTLAND, May 12, 1709) - This morning, a ship pulled up to shore.  On board was a sailor with a strange tale to tell.  The man's name is Alex Selkirk.  <ANSQ1>He says he lived alone on an island for four years and four months.</ANSQ1> 
	The tale of Alex starts almost five years ago.  He was a sailor on board a ship that leaked.  The ship stopped at an island to be fixed.  <ANSQ5>Alex said he would not sail on a leaking ship.</ANSQ5>  So the ship sailed without him. 
	All Alex had were his clothes, bedding, books, compass, knife, and tools.  He had enough food for two meals.  He made a fire from some gunpowder. 
	Then he explored the island.  It was about 12 miles long.  Soon he found all the food he needed.  <ANSQ2>He ate plums, crayfish, peppers, and turnips.</ANSQ2>  <ANSQ4>He lived in a cave.</ANSQ4>
	Once, pirates came ashore but didn't find him.  At long last, a friendly ship saw his campfire.  <ANSQ3>Alex was rescued on February 12.</ANSQ3>  This time, he was happy to get on the ship.
